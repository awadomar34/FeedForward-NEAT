running the command 'python __init__.py' will run one of the following tests:

XOR test
Single Pole Balancing test

you can comment/uncomment a the test you would like to run.

# ========================================================

From the files in Tests, you can change:
-the number of times these tests are preformed
-whether or not the result of each test is written to a file

# ========================================================

In NEAT, are the files of which run the NEAT algorithm. The files are the class files of Genome, Species and Population.

In Network, are the files which are used to create phenotypes. The files are the class files which make feed-forward networks.

In Simulations, are the files which have the tests in them. These tests are the XOR problem and the Single Pole Balancing test.

# ========================================================

conn_history and node_history are used to store the innovation history of the currently running population
